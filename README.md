# CPR_bispectrum
code for the calculation of three point function induced by cross correlation between CMB polarization rotation angles and CMB anisotropic fields
calculator_bispectrum_temp.f90 is subroutine for temperature contained bispactrum calculation
calculator_bispectrum.f90 is total calculation file, also contain subroutine for polarization  contained bispactrum calculation
There are large amount of  wigner symbols calculation, so  wignerSymbols-fortran.f deals with this module
